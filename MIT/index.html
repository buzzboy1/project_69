                    <p class="text-muted text-left">The Xavier Chapel was dedicated along with the school on Sept. 7, 1963. It has been home to countless Masses and also is a sanctuary when seeking a place for quiet reflection and prayer. Said one teacher: "The chapel is there at those times when the world outside of it seems to be too sad or too noisy or too busy.” It was donated by his eminence, Cardinal Richard James Cushing, Archbishop of Boston, and dedicated to Monsignor John J. Reilly, who was born in New Haven in 1896, and in 1956 became the first vicar-General of the Diocese of Norwich. He held that post when he died in 1961.</p>

The first step came when about 3,000 light bulbs and fixtures converted to LED lights. Then came the solar project; there are 1,290 solar panels on the roof of the building and on the west side of the school, where more than 100 arborvitaes are planted surrounding the panels. Xavier is fully solar powered.</p>

                On Thursday, March 18, members of Aquaponics Club and Environmental Action Club went on a joint-field trip to Roothouse Aquaponics--started and owned by St. X alum Mike McGraw '08.



                Not only do they produce amazing-tasting products, but Roothouse is "rooted in responsibility"--utilizing sustainable practices such as harvesting rainwater, relying on natural sunlight, and not using any pesticides, herbicides, or synthetic fertilizers.

                This is the third time St. Xavier High School and students have hosted the collaborative event during the past year. The drive-thru distribution event allows the students to place boxes of fresh produce into the cars of nearly 1000 families in an efficient and socially distant manner.
